# Sai's dotfiles

Dotfiles for Sai's personal use in LinkedIn [Remote Development](https://go/rdev) (rdev) environments, setting up zsh with oh-my-zsh.

Dotfiles are highly personalized, including shell aliases, files that configure `git` settings, and so forth. As such, _these_ dotfiles are Sai's and include details specific to his identity.

If you're coming from [go/rdev-dotfiles](https://go/rdev-dotfiles) treat this only as a reference template / starting point, and modify the parts you need to modify. Do not use these directly. Instead, make your own repo and adjust for you.

Neither Sai, nor anyone else, will take responsibility for your dotfiles.

Also, if you run into problems on RDev, consider the possibility that something in your personalized dotfiles setup could be interfering with the default RDev experience and make it a bit harder for the RDev team to help reproduce or solve your problem. Try using `rdev profile edit` to unregister your dotfiles, then create a new RDev and see if the issue reproduces.
